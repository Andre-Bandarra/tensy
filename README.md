## Description
Wanting to measure a log loadsensor data from multiple paraglider lines in flight I've created Tensy.

It's based on an Arduino Due, the HX711 load sensor ADC and various periferals like an LCD, SD card module and various buttons.
Created a PCB for ease of wiring.

## Features
* Up to 13 load sensors
* Up to 50 kg range on each sensor
* +/- 50gram accuracy
* 10Hz sampling rate on all sensors in parallel
* 80Hz sampling rate on single sensors possible
* All data written to SD card
* LCD display for live data
